# Traffic-Collision-Detection-System
This project aims for an integrated system utilizing computer vision for motion tracking and collision detection in tracked vehicles. By analysing sudden stops, the system captures images for collision assessment, employing techniques such as object detection, CNN,and classification. Real-time decision logic triggers alerts or actions upon collision detection, enhancing vehicle safety and operational security.
